# React Native scripts

Some custom scripts for quickly creating new React Native components.

# Usage
Place aliases inside .zshrc for convenient usage.
As an example I've placed two aliases in my .zshrc which looks like this:

--Custom Scripts
alias rnc='~/code/scripts/component_generator.zsh'
alias rns='~/code/scripts/scene_generator.zsh'

So whenever I run one of these the script will run. 

For now you have to be in the root of your project, for me that's ~/code/ProjectName  when you run the scripts.

More to come!
